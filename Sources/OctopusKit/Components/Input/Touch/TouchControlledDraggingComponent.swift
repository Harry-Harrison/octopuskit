// CHECK: Enforce `isUserInteractionEnabled`?

// CHECKED: This component works whether the `TouchEventComponent` is added to a sprite entity or the scene entity (via a `RelayComponent`) :)

// CHECK: Add a `force` option?
// CHECK: Add an optional "dead zone" radius tolerance?
// CHECK: Behavior on physics bodies.

// TODO: Camera movement support

// TODO: BUG: Fix multitouch handling even if not tracking multiple touches. (BUG 20180504B)

// PERFORMANCE: May need optimization?

// üí¨ It's possible to make the node move only when the touch moves out through its edges, by writing:
//
//  let nodePositionAndCenterDelta = node.position - node.frame.center
//  node.position = (currentTouchLocation - initialNodeCenterAndTouchPositionDelta) + nodePositionAndCenterDelta
//
//  But that does not make the touch be able to move around inside the node again without moving it. This could be a technique to improve and use for something else.

To prevent that, we only move the node if the `trackedTouch.timestamp` has mutated, by checking the `nodeTouchComponent.trackedTouchTimestampDelta`

        // ‚ö†Ô∏è BUG: 20180504B: APPLEBUG? `UITouch.location(in:)` and `UITouch.preciseLocation(in:)` for a touch "wobbles" when a 2nd touch moves near it, even if the tracked touch is stationary. ‚ö†Ô∏è Seems to be a problem on the iOS 11.3 on all devices, in all apps, like Photos.
    
        // ‚ÑπÔ∏è Do not move the node by comparing the `location` and `previousLocation` of the touch. That does not seem to be accurate, and can cause "drifts" where the "pointer" ends up in a different point in the node than where it started touching the node, at least in the iOS Simulator. Instead, store the initial position of the node, then compare the initial position of the touch with its latest position, and directly set the node's position to the final translation. This works the same as the `translation` property of a `UIPanGestureRecognizer`: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipangesturerecognizer/1621207-translation
        
        // ‚ÑπÔ∏è PERFORMANCE: Calculating the translation here should be faster than accessing the `NodeTouchComponent.touchTranslationInScene` computed property which checks for and unwraps a many optionals (node, scene, etc.)
        
        node.position = initialNodePosition + (currentTouchLocation - initialTouchLocationInScene)
        
        // #6: Update the interaction state.
        
        // ‚ÑπÔ∏è After the node moves, the state of the `NodeTouchComponent` may no longer be correct. e.g. if the touch moves too fast, it may be outside the node's bounds, so the state will be `touchingOutside`. When this component moves the node to the touch's location, the state should be restored back to `touching`, so that other components which are affected by `NodeTouchComponent` can function correctly, e.g. so they don't show a `touchingOutside` behavior or visual effect for a single frame.
        
        // ‚ÑπÔ∏è When the user performs a dragging operation, a "tap" operation is not expected, so we will instruct the `NodeTouchComponent` to not enter a `tapped` or `endedOutside` state when the user lifts the touch after moving the node.
        
        // CHECK: Should this suppression of taps be optional? Should we check if the node has moved from its initial position?
